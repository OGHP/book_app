# book_app

**Author**: Heather Palmer and Daniel Frey
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This is a basic full stack application for a book list which will render books from a PostgreSQL database. The application involves storing book objects in a database. The client can make a request to the server for retrieval of all books, which will then be rendered as a list in the browser.

The entire application will be deployed on Heroku with a PostgreSQL database provisioned.
